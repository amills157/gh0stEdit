# gh0st_edit

This repository contains initial Proof Of Concept (PoC) scripts for the gh0st edit vulnerability and scan results from images which had been edited using this method. 

Scan results are broken down between two separate attack examples

* Edited binary
* CVE inclusion

We also show an end to end demonstration of a CVE inclusion attack on a image signed using the DCT (https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/) in the videos within this repo

Part 1 - Shows the attack and the comparision of the signature before and after
Part 2 - Shows a Docker Scout compare and CVE report
