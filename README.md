# gh0stEdit

This repository contains initial Proof Of Concept (PoC) scripts for the gh0stEdit exploit and scan results from images which had been edited using this method. 

Further details on the gh0stEdit exploit can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08218).

Scan results are broken down between two separate attack examples

* Edited binary
* CVE inclusion

We also show an end to end demonstration of a CVE inclusion attack on a image signed using the DCT (https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/) in the videos within this repo

Part 1 - Shows the attack and the comparision of the signature before and after

Part 2 - Shows a Docker Scout compare and CVE report
